[Phylogenomics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenomics), conventionally defined as the intersection of phylogenetics and genomics, has become a key instrument in a wide spectrum of biological studies, including resolution of complex evolutionary relationships, assignment of taxonomic affiliation, prediction of protein molecular functions, and tracing horizontal gene transfer event. iTree automates the execution of phylogenetic analyses under multithreaded and grid-computing environments, providing a scalable high-throughput platform for performing genome-wide evolutionary analyses.
